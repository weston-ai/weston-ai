## I am a computational biologist with a robust foundation in molecular biology and biochemistry (i.e. wetlab). I love using discovery-based methods to investigate complex biological systems, and I am skilled at dissecting large datasets (e.g. metabolomics & transcriptomics) to model physiological responses to drugs and toxins. Moreover, I am fluent in the application of biostatistics, machine learning, and deep learning (e.g. recurrent neural networks) to investigate biological outcomes in controlled trials and cohort studies.
