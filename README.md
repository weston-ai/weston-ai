## I love using discovery-based methods to investigate complex biological systems, and I am skilled at dissecting metabolomics and transcriptomics to model physiological responses to drugs and toxins. Moreover, I am fluent in the application of biostatistics and machine learning to investigate biological outcomes in controlled trials and cohort studies.
